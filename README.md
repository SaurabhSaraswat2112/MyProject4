Expence Tracker


A simple Expense Tracker Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to manage their income and expenses, calculate their current balance, and store all data using Local Storage — ensuring that transactions persist even after the page is refreshed.

Current Balance — Displays the net balance (income – expenses).
Add New Transaction Form — Enter transaction name, amount, and type (income or expense).
Transaction History — Shows a list of all added transactions with delete buttons.

Enter a transaction name (e.g., “Salary” or “Groceries”).
Enter a numeric amount (e.g., 500).
Choose whether it’s Income or Expense.
Click Add Transaction.

Appear instantly in the Transaction History list.
Update the Current Balance at the top.
Be saved automatically to Local Storage, so data isn’t lost after reloading the page.

Each transaction has a Delete (✖) button.
Clicking it removes the transaction from both:
    The visible list
    The local storage
The balance updates automatically.


All transactions are saved in the browser’s Local Storage.
When the page is refreshed, saved transactions are loaded automatically.
This ensures your income and expense records persist until you manually delete them.
